# Progressive Web App (PWA) Generator
PWA Generator is a static site generator that builds and deploys Progressive Web Apps to [Netlify](https://netlify.com).

## About
PWA Generator builds static websites based on the project configuration specified in `projects.json`. It can generate everything needed for a website to functions a a progressive web app, e.g. it functions offline and it is installable. It can also deploy it to [Netlify](https://netlify.com).

## Usage
List all projects configured for building in `projects.json`
```
./pwagenerator.php projects
```

Build, deploy, and/or generate icons for a project using project configuration in `projects.json`             
```
./pwagenerator.php [project] [option]
options:
	-v verbose
	-b build
	-i generate icons
	-d deploy
```

For example:
```
./pwagenerator exampleproject.com -b
```

To create a new project, add it to `projects.json`, then build it.

### Options
- Verbose (`-v`): Provides a more verbose output for the other option selected (`-b`, `-i`, or `-d`),
- Build (`-b`): Builds the project. During this process, PWA Generator generates all files needed for the project to function. See [Build Process](#build-process) for more information.
- Generate Icons (`-i`): Generates icons for the project. During this process, PWA Generator sets up a config array and generates a set of favicons from the `img/favicon.svg` file in the project directory using [real-favicon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cli-real-favicon).
- Deploy (`-d`): Deploys the project. During this process, PWA Generator increments the project version and deploys the project directory to [Netlify](https://netlify.com) using the `netlify_id` set in `projects.json` and [netlify-cli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/netlify-cli).

## File Structure

### `files` Directory
The `files` directory contains files that are copied into the project when it is built.

Fonts in the `fonts` directory will only be copied over if they are listed in the `fonts` object in `projects.json`, e.g.:
```
"fonts": {
	"heading": "Roboto Slab",
	"body": "Roboto"
}
```

Files in the `opt` directory will only be copied over if they are listed in the `opt_files` object in `projects.json`, e.g.:
```
"opt_files": [
	"opt/google_auth.js"
]
```

### `inc` Directory
The `inc` directory contains files that are used to execute project tasks.

- `class-build.php` contains functionality for building, deploying, and generating favicons.
- `class-cli.php`  contains functionality for command line operations.
- `class-projects.php` contains functionality for getting projects from `projects.json`.
- `class-text.php` contains functionality for formatting text.

### `templates` and `template-parts` Directories
The `templates` and `template-parts` directories contain files that are used for building pages.

## Project File Structure
When a project is built for the first time, several files and directories are created in the project directory.
- `index.php`: Will not get overwritten by future builds and should contain any markup and functionality that are specific to the project.
- `js/main.ts`: Will not get overwritten by future builds and should contain any functionality that is specific to the project.
- `scss/style.scss`: Will not get overwritten by future builds and should contain any styles that are specific to the project.
- `_redirects`: [Netlify redirects file](https://docs.netlify.com/routing/redirects/). Can contain redirect and rewrite rules.
- `.gitignore`: Git ignore file. Contains a list of files and folders that Git should not track.
- `manifest.json`: Web app manifest file. Contains data that tells the browser about the progressive web app and how it should behave when installed.
- `package.json`: `npm` project data file. Contains project data for the `npm` package manager.
- `package-lock.json`: `npm` dependency version file. Contains dependency versions for packages installed by the `npm` package manager. It is automatically generated by `npm` when a package is installed.
- `robots.txt`: Robots file. Contains a list of rules to help search engines determine which pages they should and shouldn't crawl.
- `sitemap.xml`: Sitemap file. Contains a list of pages to help search engines with content discovery and thereby improves search engine optimization (SEO).
- `sw.js`: Service worker file. Contains functionality which caches assets and allows for offline browsing and a downloadable "app-like" experience.
- `tsconfig.json`: Webpack TypeScript compilation configuration file.
- `webpack.config.js`: Webpack configuation file for generating the `bundle.[hash].js` from the `js/*.ts` and `scss/*.scss` files.

### `fonts` Directory
The `fonts` directory contains font files that are copied over from `files/fonts` during the build process. Any changes made in this directory will get overwritten by future builds.

### `img` Directory
The `img` directory contains images and files that are generated via the `-i` command. A `favicon.svg` should be placed in this directory prior to running that command. 

This directory should also contain:
- Any images included in the `cache_files` object in `projects.json`. If included in `cache_files` and in the `nav.image` object in `projects.json`, the image would be used in the top header nav bar. If included in `cache_files` and in the `header.image` object in `projects.json`, the image would be used in the main header.
- A `share.jpg` image used for social media sharing.
- A featured image for any posts included in `posts.json`, which should be named the URL of the post with a file extension of `.jpg`.
- Any images included in the `screenshots` object in `projects.json`.

### `js` Directory
The `js` directory contains `.ts` files that are copied over from `files/js` during the build process, and a `bundle.[hash].js` file that is generated from these `.ts` files and files in the `scss` directory.

This directory also contains a `main.ts` file, which will be generated as a blank file on the initial build. It will not get overwritten by future builds and should contain any functionality specific to the project.

This directory can also optionally contain a `main.js`, if an uncompiled file is needed. If this is needed, this file should also be included in the `cache_files` object in `projects.json`.

### `scss` Directory
The `scss` directory contains `.scss` files that are copied over from `files/scss` during the build process.

This directory also contains a `style.scss` file, which will be generated on the initial build as a file containing only a `:root {}` declaration containing the fonts and colors from the `fonts` and `colors` objects in `projects.json`. It will not get overwritten by future builds and should contain any styles specific to the project.

## [Build Process](#build-process)
1. Gets the project configuration from `projects.json` depending on the `project` passed in via the command line.
2. Constructs several arrays that are used later in the build process.
	- The `$this->project_data['files']['compile']` array is used to compile files into the project directory.
		- Pages are added to `$this->project_data['files']['compile']`
	- The `$this->project_data['files']['copy']` array is used to copy files into the project directory.
		- Files in `files/scss` and `files/js` are added to `$this->project_data['files']['copy']`.
		- Files in `files/opt` are only added to `$this->project_data['files']['copy']` if they are also listed in the `opt_files` object in `projects.json`, e.g.:
			```
			"opt_files": [
				"opt/google_auth.js"
			]
			```
		- Font files for the heading font, body font, and Fontawesome are added to `$this->project_data['files']['copy']`.
	- The `$this->project_data['files']['cache']` array is used to add files to the `sw.js` file for caching by the service worker.
		- Files used to generate pages, `data.json` (used to generate additional pages to create an app-like search experience) and `posts.json` (used to generate blog posts), are added to `$this->project_data['files']['cache']`.
		- Files listed in the `cache_files` object in `projects.json` are added to `$this->project_data['files']['cache']`, e.g.:
			```
			"cache_files": [
				"img/logo_header.svg",
				"img/logo_nav.svg",
				"img/shortcut.png"
			]
			```
		- Files in `files/opt` are only added to `$this->project_data['files']['cache']` if they are also listed in the `opt_files` object in `projects.json`, e.g.:
			```
			"opt_files": [
				"opt/google_auth.js"
			]
			```
		- Pages are added to `$this->project_data['files']['cache']`
			- If the page is a `post` (e.g. extracted from `posts.json`), an image is also added to `$this->project_data['files']['cache']`, using the page URL and the `.jpg` file extension.
		- Font files for the heading font, body font, and Fontawesome are added to `$this->project_data['files']['cache']`
3. Adds pages `$this->project_data['sitemap']['urls']` for generating the `sitemap.xml` file later on.
4. Creates and populates the project directory if it doesn't already exist:
	- `index.php` file
	- `scss` directory and `scss/style.scss` with a `:root {}` declaration containing the fonts and colors from the `fonts` and `colors` objects in `projects.json`, e.g.
	```
	"fonts": {
		"heading": "Roboto Slab",
		"body": "Roboto"
	},
	"colors": {
		"main": {
			"normal": "92D7DA",
			"dark": "489094"
		},
		"accent": {
			"normal": "FA96C0",
			"dark": "B34F78"
		}
	}
	```
	- `js` directory and `js/main.ts`
	- `opt` directory 
	- `.gitignore` file with `node_modules`
	- `sw.js` service worker file
5. Copies files listed in `$this->project_data['files']['copy']` array into project directory.
6. Generates a `bundle.[hash].js` file from the `js/*.ts` and `scss/*.scss` files provided using [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) via [webpack-cli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/webpack-cli), then uses the `php` command with the `project`, `page`, and `project_data` passed in as arguments to compile each file in `$this->project_data['files']['compile']` into a minified `.html` file.
7. Generates the `manifest.json` file. The `manifest.json` file is copied into the project directory, then modified according to values in `projects.json` (`categories`, `screenshots`, `shortcuts`, `android_app_id`, and `apple_app_id`).
8. Replaces the following patterns in files in `$this->project_data['files']['compile']` and `$this->project_data['files']['copy']`:
	- `***FILES***`: Files from `$this->project_data['files']['cache']`
	- `***URLS***`: URLs from `$this->project_data['redirects']` and `$this->project_data['sitemap']['urls']`
	- `***REDIRECT_URLS***`: URLs from `$this->project_data['files']['compile']` and `$this->project_data['redirects']`
	- `***URL***`: The project URL from `$this->project_data['url']`
	- `***TITLE***`: The project title from `$this->project_data['title']`
	- `***DESCRIPTION***`: The project description from `$this->project_data['description']`
	- `***VERSION***`: The project version from `$this->project_data['version']` (extracted from `sw.js`)
	- `***DATE***`: date('Y-m-d')

## Fonts

	"heading": "Roboto Slab",
	"body": "Roboto"
}
